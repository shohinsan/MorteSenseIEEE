\section{Project Overview}\label{sec:project-overview}

\subsection{Project Goals and Objectives}\label{subsec:project-goals-and-objectives}
The \brand{} DIY security system, more accurately described as the Microwave Motion
Security System with SMS Notifications, was a project intended to provide efficient
and reliable security for homes and businesses. The system uses microwave motion
sensors to detect movement within a certain range and sends an SMS notification to
the owner's phone in case of any suspicious activity.

To manage the development process efficiently, the team followed the Agile Scrum framework.
The user stories in this project involved creating the sensor unit, communication module,
and SMS notification system. The Project requirements included designing an intuitive
user interface, ensuring compatibility with different devices, and developing a robust and
secure system that is easy to install and operate.

\subsection{Problem and Motivation}\label{subsec:problem-and-motivation}

The \brand{} project aims to address the growing need for accessible, cost-effective,
and reliable security solutions for residential and commercial properties.
Traditional security systems often come with high installation and maintenance
costs and complex setups, making them unattainable or impractical for many people.

The motivation behind \brand{} was to create a DIY security system that leverages
microwave motion detection technology to provide an affordable, easy-to-install, and
efficient means of monitoring and securing properties. This project is important as
it can pave the way to make more advanced security systems accessible to a wider
audience, thus improving safety and security for individuals and businesses.

To ensure real-time alerts, the system incorporates SMS notifications, which enable
swift responses to potential security breaches. This approach effectively addresses
the need for a more convenient and user-friendly security solution.

\subsection{Project Application and Impact}\label{subsec:project-application-and-impact}

In today's society, advanced security systems have become crucial in ensuring public
health, safety, and welfare. With growing concerns regarding security, the need for
efficient and reliable security systems is more pressing than ever. The Microwave Motion
Security System with SMS Notifications has gained popularity in recent years due to its
many benefits in preventing harm and property damage. This system has been designed
with critical factors such as global, cultural, societal, environmental, and economic
considerations in mind, ensuring accessibility and effectiveness for a wider range of users.

Public health, safety, and welfare are essential considerations for any security system.
The microwave motion security system with SMS notifications can detect and notify homeowners
of potential security risks, which is vital for public safety. The SMS notification feature
allows prompt action to be taken, reducing the risk of harm and property damage. By reducing
crime rates in a neighborhood, the security system can also positively impact the safety
and well-being of the community. In case of a security breach, the system can notify emergency
services which minimizes damage and protects lives.
