\section{Project Requirements}\label{sec:project-requirements}

\subsection{Domain and Business Requirements}\label{subsec:domain-and-business-requirements}
The \brand{} project had several requirements that the development team met to
create an efficient and reliable security system. %
These requirements included the system's ability to detect motion accurately and differentiate between human and
non-human motion to avoid false alarms. %
Optional requirements included distinguishing between different types of human motion, web-based monitoring and control. %
The system's non-functional requirements included being reliable, secure,
easy to use, and having a long lifespan with minimal maintenance. %

\subsection{Context and Interface Requirements}\label{subsec:context-and-interface-requirements}

With respect to interaction design, the team incorporated a user-friendly interface, clear
instructions, and collected feedback from the advisor and cohorts to ensure that the
security system was accessible to a broader audience, including older or less
technologically-savvy individuals, making it more effective and better-suited to the
intended audience. %

\subsection{Technology and Resource Requirements}\label{subsec:technology-and-resource-requirements}

There are several different resource requirements, and have been compiled into three
different categories.%

            Hardware & The Microcontroller connects to home Wi-Fi, sending API requests to the backend server post-motion detection. The motion sensor, utilizing electromagnetic radiation and the Doppler effect, employs serial communications for data exchange. Thonny compiles Micropython into C code for hardware programming.
            \\
            \hline
            Software & The Flask framework responds to hardware API requests, offering a web-based interface for remote system control. The server acts as a gateway between AWS and a SQLite database. Twilio handles SMS notifications, while AWS manages data traffic, providing diverse sensor metrics.
