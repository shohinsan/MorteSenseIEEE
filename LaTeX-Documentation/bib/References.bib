  abstract = {This paper explains various security issues in the existing home automation systems and proposes the use of logic-based security algorithms to improve home security. This paper classifies natural access points to a home as primary and secondary access points depending on their use. Logic-based sensing is implemented by identifying normal user behavior at these access points and requesting user verification when necessary. User position is also considered when various access points changed states. Moreover, the algorithm also verifies the legitimacy of a fire alarm by measuring the change in temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels, thus defending against manipulative attackers. The experiment conducted in this paper used a combination of sensors, microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi and ZigBee communication to identify user behavior at various access points and implement the logical sensing algorithm. In the experiment, the proposed logical sensing algorithm was successfully implemented for a month in a studio apartment. During the course of the experiment, the algorithm was able to detect all the state changes of the primary and secondary access points and also successfully verified user identity 55 times generating 14 warnings and 5 alarms.},
