\begin{abstract}

    In recent years, DIY security system technologies have been simplified and became more
    affordable for the general public. This coincided with the emergence of brands like Ring,
    Blink, Wyze, SimpliSafe, and Vivint, which specialized in smart home security. These
    brands offer a range of products, including front-door cameras,infrared motion sensors/
    detectors, and in-home cameras providing various views of the house. One notable drawback
    of these product ecosystems is their reliance on a mobile application and a smartphone
    capable of running it. If the application ceased to receive support or the company went
    out of business, the associated hardware might no longer function as intended, resulting
    in unnecessary e-waste and unsustainable security practices. The project addressed the
    dependency on a smartphone application by utilizing SMS text messaging within a modular
    motion detection security system. The system is part of an ecosystem that could be
    customized to meet the user's specific requirements and specifications. It was designed
    with sustainability in mind, capable of persisting even if manufacturer support became
    unavailable.
