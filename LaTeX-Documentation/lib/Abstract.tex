    In recent years, DIY security system technologies have become more
    accessible for the general public. This coincided with the emergence of brands like Ring,
    Blink, Wyze, SimpliSafe, and Vivint, which specialized in smart home security. These
    brands offer a range of products, including front-door cameras, infrared motion sensors/
    detectors, and in-home cameras providing various views of the house. One notable drawback
    of these product ecosystems is their reliance on a proprietary mobile application and a
    smartphone capable of running it. If the application ceased to receive support or the
    company went out of business, the associated hardware might no longer function as intended,
    resulting in unnecessary e-waste and unsustainable security practices. The proposed system
    design addressed the dependency on proprietary software by utilizing flexible software
    design within a modular motion detection security system. The proposed design entails an
    ecosystem that could be customized to meet specific user requirements and specifications. It
    was designed with sustainability in mind, capable of being thoroughly customized to
    different tools and services.
